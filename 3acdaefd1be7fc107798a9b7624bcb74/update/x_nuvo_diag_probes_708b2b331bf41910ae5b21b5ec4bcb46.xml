        <description>PartsSource  Integration - System creating Records for parts and Models&#13;
&#13;
Every time when a part is ordered, multiple manufacturers, as well as models, are getting created by the system. Also, the values under the model field are parts that are active=false on the Clinical Models table.&#13;
&#13;
When we create any CPOLITM of part type and purchase any part, System is creating a new record in parts &amp; models table with the same number as Model name(in model) and OEM part name(in parts).&#13;

        <remediation>As per Script Include  PartsSourceUtilsClient  set autoInsert to false...this will stop parts from being created, along with their Company and Model records&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This will prevent the integration from creating any part/model/manufacturer records.  If the integration today is creating multipes that they consider duplicates, it's very likely that these are actually not duplicates, but instead are different records with slightly different part numbers/names</remediation>
